# Implementation Progress - Focus Guard Improvements

## Overview
Implementing improvements from `improvments.md`:
1. Evaluation cadence refinement (reset on URL change)
2. Distraction detection with user justification
3. Full-page modal for off-topic alerts
4. Revalidation API with user explanation

---

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: URL Change Detection & Rate Limiting ✅
- [x] Update `storage.js` to track URLs per tab
- [x] Modify `canEvaluateTab()` to check if URL has changed
- [x] Update `setTabEval()` to store current URL
- [x] Add URL change detection logic
- [x] Update content script to detect URL changes
- [x] Reset evaluation timer on URL change

### Phase 2: Service Worker - Revalidation Logic ✅
- [x] Add `REVALIDATE_PAGE` message handler in service worker
- [x] Create `revalidateWithExplanation()` function
- [x] Update prompt to include user explanation
- [x] Handle revalidation response
- [x] Maintain session count for revalidations

### Phase 3: Full-Page Modal UI ✅
- [x] Create CSS for full-page overlay modal
- [x] Design centered modal box with red highlight
- [x] Add dimmed background overlay
- [x] Create modal HTML structure in content script
- [x] Add animation/transitions for modal appearance
- [x] Ensure modal is accessible (ESC to close)

### Phase 4: User Justification Input ✅
- [x] Add text input field to modal
- [x] Add "Explain relevance" button
- [x] Handle user input submission
- [x] Show loading state during revalidation
- [x] Display revalidation result

### Phase 5: Alert UX Refinement ✅
- [x] Keep borderline alerts as subtle banner (no modal)
- [x] Show full-page modal only for `off_topic` verdict
- [x] Update `showOffTopicAlert()` to use modal
- [x] Add all action buttons to modal
- [x] Test modal dismissal on all actions

### Phase 6: Content Script Updates ✅
- [x] Add URL change listener
- [x] Update `triggerEvaluation()` to pass URL
- [x] Create `handleRevalidation()` function
- [x] Update UI to show revalidation status
- [x] Handle automatic modal dismissal on successful revalidation

### Phase 7: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test URL change detection
- [ ] Test modal appearance for off-topic pages
- [ ] Test user justification flow
- [ ] Test revalidation API calls
- [ ] Verify borderline pages still show banner
- [ ] Check rate limiting with URL changes
- [ ] Validate acceptance criteria

---

## Acceptance Criteria (from improvments.md)

- [ ] Evaluation timer resets immediately upon URL change (no artificial 1-min wait)
- [ ] Full-page modal alert shown for `off_topic`
- [ ] Modal includes text box for user justification
- [ ] Justification triggers revalidation (goal + page + explanation)
- [ ] If revalidation score ≥ 80, modal closes automatically
- [ ] If revalidation score < 80, modal remains until user chooses another action
